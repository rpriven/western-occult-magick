This repository is for helping you to learn about yourself using the four basic occult sciences of the 
Western Mystery Tradition which has its roots in Egypt:

- Tarot
- Astrology
- Qaballah
- Numerology

The first of these I'm working on is Numerology.  The bith-path script is partially complete, it needs to be updated with details
about the meaning of the numbers.  Next will be the Life Path script.

The Numerology script will be able to give you a full reading about your nature and abilities.  Eventually the goal is for it to 
give you a ful 365 day calendar of the daily numbers as well as your daily numbers for various use cases.  I would also like
to be able to give it a decent interface as a program or on a website instead of just being run in the command-line.

Stay tuned, I'm looking forward to working on this more.

Thank you!
