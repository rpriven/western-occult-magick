# western-occult-magick

This repository is for helping you to learn about yourself and the world (micro- and macro-cosm) using the four basic occult sciences of the 
Western Mystery Tradition which has its roots in Egypt:

- Tarot
- Astrology
- Qaballah
- Numerology

The first of these I'm working on is Numerology.  The bith-path script is partially complete, it needs to be updated with details
about the meaning of the numbers.  Next will be the Life Path script.

The Numerology script will be able to give you a full reading about your nature and abilities.  Eventually the goal is for it to 
give you a ful 365 day calendar of the daily numbers as well as your daily numbers for various use cases.  I would also like
to be able to give it a decent interface as a program or on a website instead of just being run in the command-line.

6/25 - Found an issue with the birth-path script which reduces even a master number if there are more than two digits.  Not an issue
      in the usage of this script but will look for ways to improve the code so that it works better.
    
6/27 - The life-path script is getting close, however I'm running into an issue similar to above in which a master number is being
      reduced when it should not.  Looking for an improvement so that it adds each number up as it goes through the for loop so
      that it doesn't get too big and reduces incorrectly.
      
6/28 - The life-path script is complete except for adding more details about what the numbers actually mean.  I'll probably have more
      completed on this tomorrow.

Stay tuned, I'm looking forward to working on this more.

Thank you!
